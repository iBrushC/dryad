# Dryad â€” The AI-Based D&D Game

Dryad is a game where the user interacts with a virtual dungeon-master and plays through a campaign of dungeons and dragons. Fully written in Python, the game uses a simple commandline interface which is backed by powerful neural networks.

This game is still currently in the early alpha development stages until further notice will have almost no playable content.

## Development Checklist:
- [x] Create development checklist
- [x] Basic command line interface
  - [x] Fix flickering issues
  - [x] Add area for multiple players and dice rolling
- [x] Create ActionScript
- [x] Create ActionScript interpreter
  - [x] Create Hard Interpreter (hard-coded, set amount of actions, no room for error)
  - [ ] Create Soft Interpreter (neural network, unlimited possibilities, more room for error)
  - [ ] Create Oob Interpreter (mixture of both hard and soft interpreters, best of both worlds)
- [ ] Set up memory database
- [x] Set up Player class
- [x] Set up Object class
- [x] Link Objects and interactions to GUI
- [x] Add functioning dice
- [ ] Impliment turn system
- [ ] Create Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network to convert normal english to ActionScript
- [ ] Create NLP neural network to convert ActionScript to normal english
- [ ] Impliment NLP neural networks
- [ ] Create fantasy name generation neural network
- [x] Set up Location class
- [ ] Make area and map creator (hidden)
- [ ] Make story summary creator neural network (probably finetuned GPT-3)
- [ ] Create location interpreter
- [ ] Coherently combine all elements
